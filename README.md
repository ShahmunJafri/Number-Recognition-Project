# numberRecognition
This is a personal progress report to skills in machine learning. This project is a personal one, and my long term goal with this project is to create a classifier that can recognize any handwritten number with n number of digits.  

This was created in Jupyter Notebook and has several comparisons of different types of machine learning algorithms from simple linear regression to Gradient Descent
